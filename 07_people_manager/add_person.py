    Prompts the user to input a new person's name, age, and role, validates the input,
    and adds the person to the provided people dictionary using a unique ID.

    This function performs the following steps:
    - Asks the user for a name and validates it based on alphabetic characters and length.
    - Prompts for age and role, validating both according to the specified constraints.
    - Generates a unique ID using the provided id_generator.
    - Adds the validated person to the people dictionary with the generated ID.

    Parameters:
        people (dict[int, dict]): The dictionary where new people are stored.
        id_generator (Iterator[int]): An iterator that produces unique integer IDs.
        allowed_roles (list[str]): A list of valid roles to choose from.
        min_name_length (int): The minimum length allowed for a name.
        max_name_length (int): The maximum length allowed for a name.
        min_age (int): The minimum allowed age.
        max_age (int): The maximum allowed age.
