    Prompts the user to change the role of an existing person in the system.

    The function asks for a valid user ID and a new role from the list of allowed roles.
    If the selected new role is different from the person's current role, the change is
    applied and a confirmation message is printed. If the new role is the same, the user
    is prompted to try again.

    Parameters:
        people (Dict[int, Dict[str, Any]]): A dictionary mapping user IDs to personal
        details, including 'name', 'age', and 'role'.
        roles (list[str]): A list of valid roles that users can be assigned to.
